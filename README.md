# Task: Develop the first fold of the website based on the provided Figma design.

# Step 1: Create HTML Structure

Create HTML file with necessary structure:
- Head section with meta tags, title, and linked CSS file
- Body section with:
  - Header (logo, navigation, and call to action button)
  - Carousel section for products

# Step 2: Add CSS Styling

Create CSS file to style the HTML elements:
- Style the header (logo, navigation, and button)
- Style the carousel section (layout, transitions, colors, etc.)

# Step 3: Implement Header Section

HTML:
- Add logo image tag
- Create navigation menu using <ul> and <li> elements
- Add call to action button

CSS:
- Style the header elements (positioning, colors, font styles, etc.)

# Step 4: Create JSON Data for Carousel Section

Create a JavaScript file to store JSON data for the products:
- Each product should have properties for text, price, product image URL, and ambient color

Example JSON data:
const products = [
  {
    id: 1,
    text: {
      title: "Product Title",
      subtitle: "Product Subtitle",
      description: "Product Description",
      price: "$49.99"
    },
    image: "product1.jpg",
    ambientColor: "#FF0000"  // Example ambient color
  },
  // Add more product objects as needed
];

# Step 5: Render Products from JSON Data

JavaScript:
- Fetch JSON data and parse it
- Use the parsed data to dynamically generate HTML elements for each product in the carousel section
- Apply the dynamic text overlay and ambient color to each product slide

# Step 6: Implement Smooth Scrolling Transitions

JavaScript:
- Use a library like Splide.js or similar to initialize the carousel with smooth scrolling transitions
- Configure options such as autoplay, interval, perPage, etc.

# Step 7: Unit Testing

Test the functionality of the header (navigation, button), carousel section (slides, transitions), and dynamic text overlay (changes on scroll).

# Step 8: Deployment

Deploy the website on a free hosting platform for testing and demonstration purposes.

# Step 9: Finalize and Submit

Ensure everything is working as expected, make any necessary adjustments, and submit the completed first fold of the website.
